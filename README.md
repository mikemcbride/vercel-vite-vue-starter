# Vercel Vite Vue Starter

This is a pretty opinionated starter template for creating Vue apps. It uses:

- Vite as the dev server
- Vue 3 for the UI
- Tailwind CSS for styles
- Headless UI components from Tailwind Labs
- Heroicons for SVG Icons (also from Tailwind Labs)
- Has an API folder set up ready to go with serverless functions for Vercel

For more detailed info, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` and the base app will have documentation.
